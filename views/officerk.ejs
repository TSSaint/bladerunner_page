            <h5>Description:</h5>
            Officer K is a Nexus-9 Replicant model (though this is not explicitly stated in Blade Runner 2049) . K is tasked by the LAPD with "retiring" outdated Nexus-8 Replicant models, which were rushed into production in 2020 by the Tyrell Corporation upon the death of its founder, Dr. Eldon Tyrell, in 2019. A number of the remaining Nexus-8 models have formed the Replicant Freedom Movement, which K and the LAPD seek to terminate as well.

            On June 30th, 2049, following his "retirement" rogue replicant Sapper Morton earlier in the day, K's superior in the LAPD, Liutenant Joshi, tasks him with terminating the child of the female replicant whose remains were unearthed from beneath Sapper's Tree.
