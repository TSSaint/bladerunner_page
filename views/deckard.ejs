            <h5>Description:</h5>
            Rick Deckard is a Blade Runner, a special member of the L.A. Police Department who is employed to hunt down and "retire" replicants (genetically manufactured humanoids). Since they were declared illegal on Earth, it is up to the Blade Runners to "retire" any that find their way to Earth. At the beginning of the film, Deckard is called out of retirement after a group of six clever and brutal replicants hijack a shuttle to Earth, intending to pass themselves off as normal humans.

            <br>
            Deckard is reluctant to resume work, but is told he has no choice and must use some of "the old blade runner magic" to succeed.
